# Kickstarter-analysis
### Overview Of Project
  The purpose of the analysis is to understand the relationships between all the pleadges for the theaters outcomes in month to the number of successful pledges in various ranges. 
### Analysis and Challenges
   By analyzing pivot charts such as ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92479644/147802222-e4a3b989-106b-444f-9f01-d07dae2ff5fa.png)  
   we can draw a conclusion that there is a noticable change in terms of the months that are most likely to have success in completeing its pledging goals. Such months are May, June, July and August. While the outcomes of the pledges are at a much higher success rates on smaller projects, and a 50/50 chance for goals succeeds $25,000-$40,000.

### Challeges Encountered
  Some of the difficulties of this project includes drilling data the raw data to percentages and using those numbers to accrately displaying the relationships between the number of projects that are successful in reachings its pledging goals and the ones that were not. While finding the most comprehensive graph to illistrate the findings.
### Results
  In conclusion, the kickstarter analysis I find that most of the pledges ranging from the summer months have the highest success rates and this can be due to that the summer months is usually the peak season for television as well as big studio movies. While theres a signicicant drop in the latter months. With a big dip in the total amount of projects.
  Based on the findings I've gathered from the Outcomes base on Goals, I can conclude that majority of the projects are ranged between $0-$10,000 have more than a 50% chance of receciving its intial goals.
