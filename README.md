# Kickstarter-analysis
### Overview Of Project
  The purpose of the analysis is to understand the relationships between all the pledges for the theaters' outcomes in the month to the number of successful pledges in various ranges.
### Analysis and Challenges
   By analyzing pivot chart ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92479644/147802222-e4a3b989-106b-444f-9f01-d07dae2ff5fa.png)  
  we can conclude that there is a noticeable change in terms of the months that are most likely to have success in completing its pledging goals. Such months are May, June, July, and August. While the outcomes of the pledges are at a much higher success rate on smaller projects, and a 50/50 chance for goals succeeds $25,000-$40,000.

### Challeges Encountered
  Some of the difficulties of this project include drilling data from the raw data to percentages and using those numbers to accurately display the relationships between the number of projects that are successful in reachings their pledging goals and the ones that were not. While finding the most comprehensive graph to illustrate the findings.
### Results
  In conclusion, from the Kickstarter analysis, I find that most of the pledges ranging from the summer months have the highest success rates and this can be due to the that the summer months are usually the peak season for television as well as big studio movies. While there's a significant drop in the latter months. With a big dip in the total amount of projects. Based on the findings I've gathered from the chart "Outcomes Base on Goals". I can conclude that majority of the projects are ranged between $0-$10,000 have more than a 50% chance of receiving their initial goals.
